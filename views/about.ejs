      <p ><strong>This website was designed and built by engineering students at Washington State University for their Senior Capstone Project.</strong></p>
      <p>The primary goal of this project is to use machine learning to showcase high-risk areas for wildfires in Washington State. This will serve to increase awareness of defensive measures homeowners can take against wildfires.</p>
